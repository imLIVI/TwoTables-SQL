# TwoTables-SQL
### Description
1. Write a script for creating a table with parameters:
* table name — ```CUSTOMERS```;
* it contains 5 columns — ```id```, ```name```, ```surname```, ```age```, ```phone_number```;
* the ```id``` field will be the primary key, which is incremented each time a user is created.

2. Write a script for creating a table with parameters:
* table name — ```ORDERS```;
* it contains 4 columns — ```id```, ```date```, ```customer_id```,```product_name```,``` amount```;
* the ```id``` field will be the primary key, which is incremented each time an order is created.;
* the foreign key in the ```id``` field of the user table will be ```customer_id```.

3. Write a script that will return the ```product_name``` fields from the tables for users with the name ```alexey```, regardless of the case of the name input.

As a result, you should have three script files with the SQL extension. Put the written scripts in a separate repository on GitHub and attach a link to it in the homework comment.
